# Badge Builder Hub Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As contributors and maintainers of the Badge Builder Hub project, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our project and community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all contributors and users to help us create a positive and safe experience for everyone.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of promoting an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all members of our community to show respect and courtesy to others. Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being supportive of one another and lifting each other up.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of behavior that are considered unacceptable in our community include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any form.
- Offensive comments or jokes related to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking.
- Inappropriate or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Public or private harassment or trolling.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from the project community without warning.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please notify us by contacting [maintainer's email address]. All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed promptly. Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
